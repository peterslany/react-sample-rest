## What is this project?

This is open-sourced responsive React application , which I created in order to practice React and other web technologies.
This app consists of 2 main sections:

 - Parallax storytelling section, where I put some information about me using parallax scrolling effect.
 - News section, which is using Guardian API to fetch articles, which you can search for using that section search bar. It is sending requests to own REST API server, running on localhost which sends requests to Guardian APIs using secret API key and redirects responses.
 
 ### Technologies I used

  -  React (+ React Spring for parallax, React Transition Group for transitions)
  -  Typescript
  -  Ant Design CSS framework for faster styling
  -  Redux for state management
  -  Docker for containerization
  -  NodeJS with Express.js for REST API server
  -  Nginx for HTTP server
